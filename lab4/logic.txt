Question 1:
	Here in the n square minus 1 puzzle. the idea is to move the empty cell in possible directions 
	(ie ,  up, down, left, right). and this if we list accordingly will generate a graph.
	and doing a bfs in this graph will yeald us the answer.

Question 2:
	In this lab the idea was to create a random maze for doing dijkstra and a star later . And to 
	create such an environment. hill generation algorithm is used. 
	in this algorithm we'll first select a random point , then we'll select a random radius lying
	betweem 0 and a certain value. Once we have the position and radius ready. Then we will change
	the blocks lying around that point with that radius to be 1 (ie, not-permitting)
