	Here the agent is decision making process is random and markovian . This program is used to show 
the curse of dimentionality. For that we'll consider three types of grids . each having one, two and three
dimensions respectively.In each grid the start state is the origin and goal state is the vector vi=L for all
i in dimensions.
	Here we'll also demonstrate what are the changes when the degree of freedom is increased and decreased
and the results are "when degree of freedom increases the number of steps taken is less and when the degree 
of freedom is decreased the agent has to take more steps to reach goal state" . which is the result we
expected.
